# Energy-Efficiency-Prediction

### Problem Statement

**This project tackles the problem of predicting the energy efficiency of buildings based on various design parameters using machine learning models. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can estimate energy consumption and heating load of buildings, which can help architects and engineers in designing more energy-efficient buildings.**
